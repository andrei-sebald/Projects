# GxPReady Toolkit
## This is an app created to solve common problems in the pharmaceutical industry:
  I am developing this app because my dad is a validations consultant who complains alot about tedious tasks. This app is supposed to be a center for useful tools that a pharmacy technician would use. For example, there are three seperate standards for cleanliness in a sterile room, and this app has an automatic conversion between any of the standards. More importantly it is an opportunity to practice my React Native.
