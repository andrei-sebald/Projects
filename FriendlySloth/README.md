## I installed a servo and proximity sensor in my stuffed sloth

Since I work remotely, I sometimes get lonely in my room. I've heard stories of water cooler talk and hallway waves, and wanted to experience some of the community of an in person role. 

So naturally, I connected a proximity sensor and servo to my ESP-8266 and programmed a stuffed sloth that waves at you when you get within two meters.
